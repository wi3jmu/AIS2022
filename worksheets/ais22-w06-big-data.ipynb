Each worker node applies the map function to the local data, and writes the output to a temporary storage.\n","1. __Shuffling__: \"Shuffle\" the Map output to the Reduce processors. \n","1. __Reduce__: Run the user-provided Reduce() code. The Reduce processors process each group of output data, per key, in parallel.\n","1. __Final result__: Produce the final output – the MapReduce system collects and sorts all the Reduce output\n","\n","\n","### 1.1.
